                    <h2>Flight(2012 film)</h2>
                    <hr color="#e1e3e4">
                    <p>Flight is a 2012 American drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis, written by John Gatins and produced by Walter F. Parkes,
                        Laurie MacDonald, Steve Starkey, Zemeckis, and Jack Rapke. Loosely inspired by the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261,
                        the film stars Denzel Washington as William "Whip" Whitaker Sr., an alcoholic airline pilot who miraculously crash-lands his
                        plane after a mechanical failure, saving nearly everyone on board. Although hailed a hero, an investigation soon begins to
                        cast the captain in a different light.</p>

                    <p>Flight premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 14, 2012, and was theatrically released the following month on November
                        2. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Washington's performance and Zemeckis' return to live-action 
                        filmmaking, his first such film since Cast Away and What Lies Beneath in 2000. The film was also a commercial success, grossing 
                        $161.8 million against a production budget of $31 million. Flight appeared on multiple critics' year-end top ten lists and received
                        two nominations at the 85th Academy Awards for Best Actor (Washington) and Best Original Screenplay (Gatins).</p>
                    <h2>Pilot</h2>   
                    <hr color="#e1e3e4">
                    <p>Airline pilot Captain Whip Whitaker uses cocaine to stay alert after a sleepless night in his Orlando hotel room. He pilots SouthJet Flight 227 to Atlanta, which experiences severe turbulence at takeoff. Co-pilot Ken Evans takes over while Whip discreetly mixes vodka in his orange juice and takes a nap. He is jolted awake as the plane goes into a steep dive. Unable to regain control, Whip is forced to make a controlled crash landing in an open field, hitting his head and losing consciousness on impact.</p> 
                    <p>Whip awakens in an Atlanta hospital with moderate injuries and is greeted by his old friend Charlie Anderson, who represents the airline's pilots union. He tells Whip that he managed to save 96 out of 102, losing two crew members and four passengers, but mentions his co-pilot is in a coma. Whip sneaks away for a cigarette and meets Nicole Maggen, a heroin addict recovering from an overdose in the same hospital. The next morning, his friend and drug dealer Harling Mays picks him up from the hospital.</p>
                    <p>Having retired to his late father's farm, Whip meets Charlie and attorney Hugh Lang, who explain that the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) performed a drug test while he was unconscious. Results showed that Whip was intoxicated during the flight, although Hugh gets the toxicology report voided on technical grounds. Whip visits and becomes intimate with Nicole, but his drinking habits clash with Nicole's attempts to stay whom Whip had spent the night before the incident. He sees a surviving crew member, Margaret, and asks her to tell the NTSB that he was sober.</p>
                    <p>Whip pays a visit to his co-pilot Ken Evans after he awakens from his coma. Evans has likely lost much of his ability to walk and may never pilot an airplane again. Although upset, Evans has no intention of telling the NTSB that Whip was drinking. Nicole decides to separate from Whip after he fails to stay sober and he spontaneously drives to the home of his ex-wife and son, both of whom resent him. Hounded by the media, he stays with Charlie until the NTSB hearing, vowing not to drink. The night before the hearing, Charlie and Hugh move Whip to a guarded hotel room with no alcohol. He finds the door to an adjacent room unlocked and raids the minibar there.</p>
                    <p>The next morning, Charlie discovers Whip passed out drunk. Whip and Charlie call Harling to provide Whip with cocaine, hoping to get him alert enough to make it through the hearing. At the hearing, lead NTSB investigator Ellen Block explains that a damaged elevator assembly jackscrew was the primary She then reveals that two empty vodka bottles were found in the plane's trash, despite beverages not being She then states the only other member of the crew to test positive for alcohol was Katerina. Whip pauses, unable to bring himself to blame Katerina for his actions. He collects himself and comes clean, admitting to being intoxicated the day of the crash. A tearful Whip also admits that he is presently drunk and has a problem, coming to terms with his alcoholism.</p>
                    <p>Thirteen months later, an imprisoned Whip is lecturing a support group of fellow inmates telling them he is glad to be sober and doesn't regret doing the right thing. He is also working to rebuild his relationship with his son, who visits to interview Whip for a college application essay titled "The most fascinating person that I've never met". He begins by asking, "Who are you?" As a plane flies overhead, Whip replies, "That's a good question."</p>
